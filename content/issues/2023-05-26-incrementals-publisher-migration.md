[Final message]

Migration completed with no disruption

[Initial message]
A migration of the Incremental Publisher (`incrementals-publisher.jenkins.io`) application from `prodpublick8s` cluster to `publick8s` cluster is planned today on Friday 26th of May 2023 at 16h15 UTC.

No downtime is expected as the service is stateless but slowness might happen.
