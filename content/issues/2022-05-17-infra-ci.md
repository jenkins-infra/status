[close]
AKS outage finished: everything is back to normal.

[update]
There is an AKS outage on US East 2, which impacts the Virtual Machines allocation: <https://app.azure.com/h/MSR7-9Z0/dffcf0>.

- [infra.ci.jenkins.io] No builds using Kubernetes-based agent can be executed. "Website Pull Requests preview" feature is unavailable.
  - Cause: The Kubernetes cluster `temp-privatek8s` is unable to launch new Virtual machines nodes: infra.ci.jenkins.io cannot handle builds.
- [ci.jenkins.io] Increased build queue as only AWS is used for Docker Agents virtual machines.

[initial message]
Cluster automatic scaling to handle builds is not working anymore on infra.ci.jenkins.io so it may have difficulties with builds and it could also impact the preview system used within www.jenkins.io
