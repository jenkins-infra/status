[Final message]
We manually tested and purged the fastly cache and saw the errors (on team members affected networks) disappearing.

As not all users where impacted, we think it's an incident on fastly side : https://www.fastlystatus.com/incident/375724

[Initial message]
The [jenkins.io](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/security/scan/) website responds with HTTP/503 errors for some users and some pages (but not all).
