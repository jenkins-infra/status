A maintenance on get.jenkins.io (mirrors.jenkins*) will be performed with a **partial service disruption** the Friday 26 January 2024 starting at 12:00pm (noon time) UTC.

The goal of this maintenance is to migrate the underlying storage to a new system in Azure.

See https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3917 for more details.
