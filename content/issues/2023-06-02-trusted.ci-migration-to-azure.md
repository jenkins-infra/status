[Initial message]
A migration of the "Trusted" controller (`trusted.ci.jenkins.io`) virtual machines from AWS EC2 to Azure is planned today on Friday 2 of June 2023 starting at 08h30 UTC.
The service will be down until the migration is complete and finished.

It has an impact on:

- The Update Center (`updates.jenkins.io`): any release of a plugin won't be visible until the end of the migration
- The CD plugin process: the Repository Permission Updater system won't be updated until the end of the migration: Publishing a new plugin with the CD process or logging-in to Artifactory (repo.jenkins-ci.org)  could be impacted
- The Plugin site (`plugins.jenkins.io`) and the Javadoc (`javadoc.jenkins.io`) won't be updated during the migration
