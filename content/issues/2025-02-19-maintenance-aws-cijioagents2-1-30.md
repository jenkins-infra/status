Wednesday 19 February 2025, at 08:00 UTC, we'll upgrade the EKS(AWS) cluster hosting ci.jenkins.io's container agents and Artifact Caching proxy to Kubernetes 1.30.9

All agents using `jnlp-linux-*` or `jnlp-bom` labels, or pipelines with the `buildPlugin()` function with `useContainer: true` will be queued until the end of the operation.
