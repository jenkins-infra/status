**Update 2021-05-03 11:58 UTC

The operation is successful, we are now waiting several hours before deleting
the temporary resources that we created during the transition to be sure
that no DNS traffics is redirected to those locations.
We didn't notice service downtime during the process.

* [INFRA-2743](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-2743)
* [NOTES](https://hackmd.io/cH4rbENeSOGLHD3rAgnXqQ?both)

There is no ETA at the moment.

We are upgrading the nginx ingress controllers on the Kubernetes cluster publick8s.
While no down time is expected, the risk during this upgrade is to stop redirecting HTTP/HTTPS traffics to the following services:

Public services:
* www.jenkins.io
* plugins.jenkins.io
* javadoc.jenkins.io
* get.jenkins.io
* fallback.get.jenkins.io
* reports.jenkins.io
* uplink.jenkins.io
* customize.jenkins.io
* incrementals.jenkins.io
* beta.accounts.jenkins.io
* mirror.azure.jenkins.io
* jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io
* archives.azure.jenkins.io

Private services:
* release.ci.jenkins.io
* infra.ci.jenkins.io
* admin.accounts.jenkins.io
* grafana.publick8s.jenkins.io

The operation consists of deploying temporary ingress controllers listening on ephemeral IPs.
