[Final message]

Migration finished.

See https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3414 for more details.

[Initial message]

We'll migrate scripts used by the update center from blobxfer to azcopy today at 13h30 UTC, which might result in a latency of plugins new releases availability.

See https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3414 for more details.
