A maintenance on the Plugin site is planned, to upgrade its dependencies and fix an ongoing DNS issue.

* The website plugins.jenkins.io should not be impacted as it's cached by a CDN, worst case scenario is an outage of ~1 min time to rollback
* The website plugins.origin.jenkins.io will be stopped for the duration of the maintenance
