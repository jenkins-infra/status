[Final Message]
The ci.jenkins.io controller is back to a normal response time. The AI crawler has stopped sending requests.
We had to restart the controller once per hour to sustain the high rate of requests.

[Initial message] -->
ci.jenkins.io is failing with Out Of Memory errors, we've restarted it.
We don't know yet the exact cause but we're suspecting AI crawlers.
