<!-- [Final Message]
The ci.jenkins.io controller is now up and running, the brownout is done, we will have to work around permission for the next brownout.

More details in <https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4768>.

[Initial message] -->
ci.jenkins.io was failing with Out of Memory errors, we've restarted it. We don't know yet the exact cause but we're suspecting AI crawlers.

More details to come.
