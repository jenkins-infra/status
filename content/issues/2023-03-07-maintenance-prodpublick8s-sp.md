We'll perform an operation on the AKS cluster `prodpublick8s` the 07 of March 2023 at 13:00 UTC.

The goal of this operation is to rotate the (soon-to-be-expired) Azure Service Principal credential for this cluster.

This operation will restart all the machines of the cluster.

The following services will be restarted (e.g. unavailable during the restart phase):

- ldap.jenkins.io (authentication on ci.jenkins.io and issues.jenkins.io is affected)
- reports.jenkins.io

The following services will be migrated without downtime (but slower response time during the operation):

- accounts.jenkins.io
- get.jenkins.io
- incrementals.jenkins.io
- javadoc.jenkins.io
- jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io
- plugins.jenkins.io
- stories.jenkins.io
- uplink.jenkins.io
- www.jenkins.io
