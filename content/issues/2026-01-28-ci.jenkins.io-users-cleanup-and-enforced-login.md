[Initial Message]
On Wednesday 28 January 2026 at 18h15 UTC, ci.jenkins.io will require authentication with a Jenkins LDAP account to allow reading pages.

As part of this change, the users database will be wiped out, effectively removing all API tokens and personal preferences.
Direct consequence: incrementals.jenkins.io won't be able to deliver new incremental releases until a new API token is generated.
