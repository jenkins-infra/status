[Final]
GH releases published for the Docker Image: https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/releases/tag/2.466 (and https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/releases/tag/2.465 marked as burnt)

[Update]
The issue seems to be related to a Maven plugin version bump. The release 2.465 is considered burnt and we are starting 2.466 release as a replacement.

[Initial message]
The Jenkins Core weekly release 2.465 failed. We are investigating.
