Thursday November 14 2024, the `ci.jenkins.io` controller will be restarted to upgrade the `datadog` plugin as per <https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4377>.

If this operation ends up in corrupting the build log like the previous ones, we'll immediately restore the backup and restart the controller.
