The JIRA instance at issues.jenkins.io, managed by the Linux Foundation team, will be down for up to two hours beginning at 17:00 (UTC) Monday December 18, 2023 so that it can be restored from backup.
A spammer damaged over 1000 Jenkins issue reports on Dec 6, 2023.
A database backup will be restored that precedes the damage.
