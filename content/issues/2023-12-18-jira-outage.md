The JIRA instance at issues.jenkins.io, managed by the Linux Foundation team, will be down for up to 60 minutes beginning at 11:00 PM (UTC) Monday December 18, 2023 so that it can be restored from backup.
A spammer damaged over 1000 Jenkins issue reports on Dec 6, 2023.
We will restore a database backup that precedes the damage.
