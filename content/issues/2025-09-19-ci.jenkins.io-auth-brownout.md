[Final Message]
The ci.jenkins.io controller is now up and running, the brownout is done, we will have to work around permission for the next brownout.

More details in <https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4768>.

[Initial message]
A large set of unhelpful requests are overloading ci.jenkins.io.
We are in a brownout.
We are testing that disallowing anonymous access resolves the performance issue.
