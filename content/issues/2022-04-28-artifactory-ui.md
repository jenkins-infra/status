[Initial message]
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
We were alerted by some users that the Web UI of the JFrog's Artifactory service at <https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/ui> is unavailable: it answers HTTP/503 errors with an error page.

This outage does NOT affect the ability to download or upload artefacts in the service.

See <https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2904> for more details.
