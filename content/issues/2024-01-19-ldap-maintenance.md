Friday January 19 2024, starting at 08:45am UTC, we'll proceed to a maintenance on the LDAP service (`ldap.jenkins.io`) hosted in the `publick8s` Azure Kubernetes cluster.

Authentication on all of the `*.jenkins.io` and `*.jenkins-ci.orf` services will be unavailable during the operation.
We expect a disruption between 5 and 30 min.

The goal is to update the LDAP image to a new version to use a new deployment system.
