In order to migrate infra.ci.jenkins.io to its new cluster (see https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2844), we'll need to shut down this instance.

Apart from infra.ci.jenkins.io jobs concerning jenkins-infra repositories, jenkins.io preview deployments will also be impacted.

Expected downtime: 1 hour
